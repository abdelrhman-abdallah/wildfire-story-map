// --- Terrain shade overlay ("Multiply" without a blend mode) -------------
// Built by topo_work/11_hillshade_shade.py from the USGS 3DEP 1 m LIDAR DEM,
// clipped to CSA 14 and warped to Web Mercator.
//
// This is NOT a picture of a hillshade. It is a picture of the shading
// OPERATOR, and the difference is the whole reason the map now reads as 3D.
//
// The first version of this overlay was a grey hillshade drawn UNDERNEATH the
// translucent choropleths. That composite is `f*C + (1-f)*H` - a linear
// average - so every class colour got pulled toward mid-grey in proportion to
// how much relief you let through. You could have the colour or the terrain,
// never both, which is exactly the "washed out" gap against the ArcGIS Pro
// reference render (NDVI over hillshade, Layer Blend: Multiply, Transparency
// 50%).
//
// ArcGIS Multiply at transparency (1-s) is `C * (1 - s + s*H)`: it darkens by
// relief and never desaturates. MapLibre GL v4 has no blend modes - but it
// does not need them, because Multiply is exactly reproducible with ordinary
// alpha compositing by moving this layer ON TOP and encoding it as
// black-with-alpha:
//
//     src = black, alpha a  ->  result = C * (1 - a)
//     with a = s * (1 - H)  ->  result = C * (1 - s + s*H)     <- identical
//
// So in the PNG, colour carries only the SIGN of the effect (black = darken,
// white = lighten) and alpha carries the magnitude. The build script also adds
// a deliberately weak white/highlight half on the sunlit side: white-over-
// colour is `C + a*(1-C)`, a linear dodge toward white, i.e. the very
// desaturation we are escaping, so it is held at ~0.10 against the shadow
// half's ~0.50 and never gets to dominate.
//
// Consequences that are easy to get wrong later:
//   * The fills underneath must be near-OPAQUE now (see THEMATIC_OPACITY
//     below). Transparency was the old mechanism for letting relief through;
//     here transparency only lets the basemap through and dilutes the colour
//     for nothing.
//   * Never set raster-contrast / -brightness-* / -saturation on this layer.
//     Those operate on RGB and leave alpha untouched, so they cannot change
//     the strength of an alpha-encoded operator - they can only decalibrate
//     the black/white sign channel. `raster-opacity` scales alpha linearly and
//     is the one correct strength dial.
//
// Delivered as a MapLibre `image` source (one PNG + four corner coordinates)
// rather than a tiled raster source: it's a single ~2.5 x 1.5 km overlay, so
// cutting an XYZ pyramid and standing up a tile server for it would be all
// cost and no benefit. The corners are read from the sidecar JSON the build
// script emits, so regenerating the PNG at a different size or extent can
// never leave the app pointing at stale coordinates.

// CEILING. Colour and terrain were in direct competition and you had to give
// up some of one to get the other.
//
// A first pass at v18 inverted that into a 0.92 FLOOR, on the reasoning that
// since `result = fill x (1 - a)` preserves relief contrast at any fill
// opacity, transparency now buys nothing but a diluted class colour. The
// premise is right; the conclusion was not. Transparency was never only a
// carrier for the hillshade - it also lets Positron's street grid and place
// labels read through, which is how a reader finds their own block, and it
// keeps the dark end of each ramp off the floor of the tone range, where a 50%
// multiply has nothing left to darken. At 0.92 the "very dense" green went
// nearly black under shadow and the relief stopped reading inside it.

// So: no floor, no ceiling. The shade handles relief, these defaults handle

// --- Wind arrows --------------------------------------------------------
// Schematic Diablo (offshore, NE->SW) and reverse (onshore, SW->NE) wind
// arrows. They're decorative annotations rather than a data layer, so they
// ride on MapLibre markers instead of going through
// LEGEND_LAYER_IDS/setMapLayerVisibility - but being markers (not a fixed
// HTML overlay) they stay pinned to the ground as the reader pans and
// zooms. All of them appear/disappear together on chapter.layers.wind.
//
// They also DRIFT: each arrow slides along its own heading and fades out,
// looping, so the pair of fans animates like moving air. The brief asks for
// this explicitly ("pulsing arrows ideally or slightly advancing in the
// wind direction").
//
// The animation runs on the <svg> INSIDE the marker element, never on the
// marker element itself. MapLibre writes `transform` on the marker root on
// every render to place and rotate it, so any transform of ours there is
// overwritten (and would fight the map's own positioning). The child is
// untouched by MapLibre and inherits the parent's rotation for free, which
// is what makes a plain translateY on it travel downwind: the SVG is drawn
// pointing up (tip at y=1), so its local -Y is wherever the marker's
// `rotation: bearing` is aimed.
const WIND_ARROWS_PER_SIDE = 4;

// Each scenario is a curved FLOW FIELD rather than a block of parallel
// chevrons: its four arrows are spread right across Homestead and their
// headings rotate progressively from one side of the valley to the other, so
// the set reads as air bending through the terrain. The bearings are the
// editorial content - they are the regional geography:
//
//   diablo   Offshore. Spills down off the Great Basin / Nevada side on a
//            roughly SSW heading, then bends west as it drops to the coast
//            and runs out over the Pacific. 208 -> 252.
//   reverse  Onshore. Comes in off the Pacific heading ENE, then bends left
//            and straightens to very nearly due north, up the corridor
//            toward Mill Valley. 58 -> 5.
//
// Only the SHAPE is geographic. The arrows stay inside the homestead frame -
// they annotate which way the air is going as it passes through here, they
// are not a journey that begins in Nevada or ends in Mill Valley.

// --- The rank -------------------------------------------------------------
// All eight arrows sit on one line across the valley, INTERLEAVED - orange,
// blue, orange, blue - so each one has a neighbour of the other colour on
// either side and both scenarios span the whole of Homestead instead of
// clustering in opposite corners.
//
// The bearing of the rank is the load-bearing number. It is set ACROSS the
// wind axis (the two scenarios average out to roughly a 40/220 axis, so its
// perpendicular is about 130), never along it. That is what keeps the
// animation clean: neighbouring arrows are offset along the rank while they
// drift perpendicular to it in opposite directions, so a pair always slides
// APART rather than along the rank into each other. A rank laid along the
// wind axis would have every arrow drifting straight at its neighbour.
//
// 118 rather than a true 130 is the compromise the bbox forces: Homestead is
// about 1.6x wider than it is tall, so a steeper rank cannot span the width
// without running off the top and bottom edges. 118 still clears the blue
// fan's mean heading by 86 degrees and the orange fan's by 112.

// what keeps the motion reading as curved rather than as a rigid chevron
// sliding down a diagonal.

// is set here is only the per-arrow PHASING, because that is what stops
// eight identical loops from pulsing in unison and reading as a blinking
// decoration.
//
// Two independent knobs, both written onto the marker element as custom
// properties and inherited by the <svg> the animation actually runs on:
//
//   --wind-duration  spread slightly per arrow, so the fan drifts out of
//                    phase over time instead of ticking like a metronome.
//   --wind-delay     NEGATIVE, which starts each arrow already part-way
//                    through its cycle. A positive delay would park every
//                    arrow at its un-animated resting state and then have
//                    them all lurch into motion as the chapter scrolls in;
//                    negative means the fan is already mid-flight the

// WIND_ARROWS_PER_SIDE is the number we WANT, not the number we always get.
// The arrows are a fixed pixel size (they are UI, not geography), but the
// rank they sit on is geographic, so it shrinks with the map panel: on a
// 1440px window the rank is ~866px long and neighbours sit ~124px apart,
// while on a 375px phone the same rank is ~190px and the gap collapses to
// ~27px. At that spacing eight arrows do not merely look tight - each one
// travels about one of its own lengths per drift cycle, so they pass clean
// through each other, which is exactly what the interleave exists to
// prevent.
//
// So the count is derived from the rank's measured on-screen length rather
// than assumed. 92px is the smallest neighbour gap that still clears, and
// it was measured, not guessed: a swept simulation of the full drift cycle
// (every pair, every phase, arrows treated as their full bounding boxes)
// puts the overlap threshold at ~88px, so 92 is that plus a little air.
//

// it is on screen - is handled at scroll time by setupMediaRegions(), not

// a chapter needing a differently-shaped legend (a bivariate matrix, and in
// future a continuous ramp bar, a graduated-symbol column, ...) is a new
// entry in LEGEND_SYMBOLOGY_RENDERERS plus some CSS - it does NOT mean
// touching renderLegendShell(), renderExplorerLegend(), or the existing
// sections, all of which stay on the default "items" renderer.
//
// Contract every renderer honours:
//   - takes the whole section object, returns an HTML string
//   - renders only the section BODY; the header, the on/off switch and the
//     .legend-section box itself belong to buildLegendSectionHtml() below,
//     so all symbologies get the same toggle behaviour for free
//   - is pure (no DOM reads, no map reads) so the same function can serve
//     the story legend and the Block Explorer legend
//
// Escaping note: labels come from our own chapters.json and legitimately
// contain markup-ish characters (en-dashes, ×, ≥), so they are interpolated
// as-is, consistent with how chapter descriptions are already handled. These
// are authored strings, never user input.

// "items" (the default) - a vertical list of swatch + label rows. "swatch"
// on an item (optional, defaults to a flat filled square) lets a row
// visually match a LINE-based map layer (marin/homesteadHighlight
// boundaries, contours, streets) instead of always rendering a filled block
// for what's actually a line on the map - "line-solid" draws a solid rule,

// The two axes are labelled differently on purpose. The y axis is

// name per row. The x axis is a continuous variable cut into classes, so it
// gets its N+1 class EDGES rendered at the cell boundaries rather than N
// ranges centred under cells: edge numbers are short enough to fit under a
// ~20px cell, where "265-393 ft" is not, and boundaries are what a reader
// actually needs to place a value.
//
// rows are authored LOW-to-HIGH on the y axis - the same orientation as
// bivariate_work/bivariate_palette.json's matrix[vegClass-1][elevClass-1] -
// so the JSON can be diffed against the palette the data was built with
// without mentally flipping it. They are reversed here because CSS grid

//
// Two kinds of region, laid end to end down the story:
//
//   * a chapter's own stretch - the whole section for a plain chapter, but
//     only the narrative BELOW the band for a map chapter;
//   * a stretch that owns no media and therefore hides the panel: a map
//     band, and the Block Explorer (not a chapter at all, so nothing else
//     would ever release the panel over it).
//
// The band has to be its own region because the two big visuals live in
// different coordinate systems - the map is a full-width band IN the page,
// the panel is pinned to the VIEWPORT - so on a chapter with both, the
// panel would sit over the right-hand 58% of the map. Hiding it behind the
// map is not an option either: .chapter-map-stage is deliberately
// transparent so the page shows through the --map-frame-pad inset that
// makes the map read as a framed exhibit, and the panel would show through
// that gap as a band of photograph running around the frame. So the panel
// yields while the band owns the screen, which also gives the reader the
// two things in sequence - here is the ground, now here is the photograph
// of it - instead of making them compete for one screen.
//
// The panel used to be driven by chapter activation plus a guard that
// fired on a map stage merely touching the viewport's bottom edge. A
// section between two maps is taller than the screen, so the next band
// reached that edge while the reader was only halfway down the text - and
// the photograph both swapped away and faded out a full screen early.
